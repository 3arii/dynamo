# Pytorch Implementation of Stable Dynamic Flows (ImitationFlows)
This library provides the models and the learning algorithms for learning deep stochastic stable dynamics by Invertible Flows.
The model is composed by a latent stochastic stable dynamic system and an invertible flow. See [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13129)

The models and the learning algorithms are implemented in PyTorch.

## Basics

Stable Dynamic Flows, named ImitationFlows in [1], represents a family of neural network architectures, 
which combines a latent stable dynamic system and an invertible neural network(Normalizing Flows).

You can find the set of stable dynamic system models in  [`dynamics`](./iflow/model/dynamics).

For the invertible networks, we have used RealNVP layer [3], Neural Spline Flows [4] and 
Neural ODE [5]. You can find our models in [`flows`](./iflow/model/flows).
