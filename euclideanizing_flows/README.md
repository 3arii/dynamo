SDSEF: Stable Dynamical System Learning Using Euclideanizing Flows
===================================================
SDSEF is a dynamical system or policy learning approach with global asymptotic stability guarantees.
For details, checkout our [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13143.pdf) in L4DC 2020.

This library is an implementation of SDSEF in pytorch.

SDSEF is being developed by [Asif Rana](mailto:asif1253@gmail.com) and [Anqi Li](mailto:anqil4@cs.washington.edu).
